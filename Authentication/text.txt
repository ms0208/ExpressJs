Authentication patterns
1. Stateful = which maintains state or data or server side.
2. Stateless = Which has no state.
// Statefull
example:-
parking ticket by parking man who parked a customer vehicles.
parking number =  Number 24
NUMBER 24: DLXXXX123 / noted. 

State :
Number 24 : DLXXXX123
so state is a data who maped with other object.
its a a statemaintained.

Architecture:-
Client -> username/passowrd -> server.
server -> session uid -> client.  id= uid:367
server keep a track in there state
when client go to  server its show a id which is uid:367

client -> get/users  | uid:367: -> server.
server-> response to -> client . this statefull work is done.

// Method to transfer uid:-
1. cookies (serverside in ejs) in Browesers
2. response 
3. headers. (REST API)

// express flow:-
client -> Auth Middleware -> endpoint route.
Auth Middleware = checks for cookie value or uid, if valid calls next() else rejects the request.
